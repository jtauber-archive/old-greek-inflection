greek-inflection
================

Python 3 library for generating (and analyzing) Ancient Greek inflectional
paradigms

Starting with verbal paradigms (I've done a lot with nominal inflection
elsewhere that will eventually be incorporated into this).

λύω is complete and I'm now moving on to contract verbs.

You'll need to `pip install -r requirements.txt` to get `greek-accentuation`
library and then just running `./verbs.py` will run tests.
